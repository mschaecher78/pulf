#Pulf (Package Ubuntu Linux Firmware)

The idea is to build a linux-firmware package (only Debian or deb package is supported),
over what is currently avialable over Ubuntu or Debian. Though Ubuntu is pretty quick
about the pushing the major firmware releases over Debian: this only applies to them and
not the smaller updates.
